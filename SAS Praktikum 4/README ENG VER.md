## Analysis
Below is the results from when we use load balancer and not using the load balancer
- When there is 50 users that access our web, if we don't use load balancer the average time of user accessing our web is
    - landing : 1580 ms = 0.158 s
    - blog : 1330 ms = 1.33 s
    - app :  5 ms = 0.005 s
- When we use load balancer, then
    - landing :  46 ms =  0.046 s
    - blog :  60 ms = 0.06 s
    - app :  43 ms = 0.043 s
#
- When there is 100 users that access our web, if we don't use load balancer the average time of user accessing our web is
    - landing :  2760 ms = 2.76 s
    - blog :  2431 ms = 2.431 s
    - app : 5 ms = 0.005 s
-   When we use load balancer, then
    - landing : 111 ms = 0.111 s
    - blog : 151 ms = 0.151 s
    - app : 88 ms = 0.088 s
#
- When there is 150 users that access our web, if we don't use load balancer the average time of user accessing our web is
    - landing : 3763 ms = 3.763 s
    - blog : 3410 ms = 3.41 s
    - app :  4 ms = 0.004 s
- When we use load balancer, then
    - landing : 293 ms = 0.293 s
    - blog : 146 ms = 0.146 s
    - app : 134 ms = 0.134 s
#
Here we can know that the average time of user accessing our web is faster then if we don't use load balancer. For the throughput or the amount of user accessing our web is
- When there is 50 users that access our web, if we don't use load balancer the amount of user accessing our web is
    - landing :  17 user / second
    - blog :  12 user / second
    - app :  18 user / second
- When we use load balancer, then
    - landing : 450 user / second
    - blog : 226 user / second
    - app : 298 user / secondâ€ƒ
#
- When there is 100 users that access our web, if we don't use load balancer the amount of user accessing our web is
    - landing :  19 user / second
    - blog :  13 user / second
    - app :  20 user / second
- When we use load balancer, then
    - landing : 363 user / second
    - blog : 178 user / second
    - app : 270 user / second
#
- When there is 150 users that access our web, if we don't use load balancer the amount of user accessing our web is
    - landing : 21 user / second
    - blog : 13 user / second
    - app :  22 user / second
- When we use load balancer, then
    - landing : 137 user / second
    - blog : 153 user / second
    - app : 139 user / second

In conclusion, the average user accesses their website 1 second faster and significantly using a load balancer and also the number of users who access is more than those who do not use a load balancer.
